## *HARNESSING AI-DRIVEN PREDICTIONS OF TOTAL ELECTRON CONTENT IN IONOSPHERE*

## *Overview*

This project focuses on predicting *Total Electron Content (TEC)* variations in the ionosphere caused by *solar flares, solar storms, and **earthquakes. Using machine learning models like **Random Forest Regressor* and *XGBoost*, we aim to analyze the impact of space weather and seismic events on space-based navigation systems.
